Inspired by the pre facebook Mark Zuckerberg's website to rate college girls and created as a learning project for React.

It uses React-Router for pagination and React's context api for state management.

Some functionality includes:
  - Logic for randomized images that are diferent from each other and diferent from the previous images displayed.
  - Filtering system based on tags.
  - A point system that adds a point with each click.
  - A ranking page that display the most liked pictures.
  - A memory system to go back to previous images. 
  - Use of local storage to save individual rankings.
